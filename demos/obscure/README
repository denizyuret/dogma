Demo for the Matlab implementation of OBSCURE contained in DOGMA

Demo
===============
The matlab script "demo_obscure" contains an example of how to use the
OBSCURE algorithm. Before running it remember to add the DOGMA directory to
the MATLAB path.

The demo uses a real-world dataset Oxford flowers as in Section 4.1 of the
OBSCURE paper in CVPR. To run it you need to go the dataset's website
(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html) and download
some file.

Once you open the webpage in your favorite web browser, you need to
download a few files:
Item 2. The data splits (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/datasplits.mat)
Item 4. Chi^2 distances CVPR 2006 (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/distancematrices17gcfeat06.mat)
Item 5. Chi^2 distances ICVGIP 2008 (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/distancematrices17itfeat08.mat)
   
When you finish downloading, put all the .mat file in demo/data folder.
Type "demo_obscure", and everything should work!

   Enjoy!
