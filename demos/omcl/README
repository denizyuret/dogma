Demo for the Matlab implemenation of the OMCL algorithm in DOGMA

Demo
===============
The matlab script "demo_omcl" contains an example of how to use the OMCL
algorithm. Before running it remember to add the DOGMA directory to
the MATLAB path.

The data used in the demo are real-world sequences from the IDOL2 database
(http://cogvis.nada.kth.se/IDOL/). It is composed by 12 sequences acquired
by the same robot, and was divided into training and testing sets. Each
cell of the training [train_data] and testing data [test_data] is
corresponding to one cue type, namely, RGB Color histogram, CRFH histogram,
Bag-of-SIFT, and Laser Scan sensor features. For more details, please refer
to the OMCL paper.
   
The mat file with the features can be found at
http://dogma.sourceforge.net/idol2.zip
Extract the file and put it in the folder demos/data.
Type "demo_omcl", and everything should work!

   Enjoy!
